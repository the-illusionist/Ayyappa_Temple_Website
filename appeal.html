	<h2>Dear Devotees,<h2>
</br>
It was the long ambition of the Keralites in Jodhpur to organise and conduct the "Ashtamangala Devaprashnam". Accordingly, it was performed by Jyotisha Vachaspati Brammasree Lal Prasad Bhattatiri and his associates on 29 and 30 may 2013 in the temple premises with the blessings of Lord ayyappa.
</br></br>
During the Devaprashnam, many abnormalities such as the measurement of thr existing temple were found and he has very strongly recommended certain points to solve them.Thereby the divine presence of Lord Ayyappa would get more power.
</br></br>
As per the suggestions, a plan was prepared for the reconstruction of the existing temple which amounted to Rs. 2000000(twenty lakhs) and it was our joint responsibility to co-operate and generously contribute to the Temple Reconstruction Fund. We , the members of Sree Ayyappa Sva Sangham sincerely request each devotee to come forward and donate for this common cause.
</br></br>
May Lord Ayyappa bless you all.
